%\title{Spinning Straw into Gold: Using Free Text to Train Monolingual Alignment Models for Non-factoid Question Answering}



%\begin{abstract}
%Monolingual alignment models have been shown to boost the performance of question answering systems by "bridging the lexical chasm" between questions and answers.
%%and associating question words like {\em breakfast} with answer words like {\em pancakes} or {\em cereal}.  %Unfortunately these models have been historically challenging to generate, requiring large and expensive corpora of aligned QA pairs to train.  
%The main limitation of these approaches is that they require semistructured training data in the form of question-answer pairs, which is difficult to obtain in specialized domains or low-resource languages.
%%While these models currently require semistructured training data in the form of question-answer pairs, 
%We propose two inexpensive methods for training alignment models solely using free text, by generating artificial question-answer pairs from discourse structures. Our approach is driven by two representations of discourse: a shallow sequential representation, and a deep one based on Rhetorical Structure Theory. 
%We evaluate the proposed model on two corpora from different genres and domains: one from Yahoo! Answers and one from the biology domain, and two types of non-factoid questions: manner and reason. We show that these alignment models trained directly from discourse structures imposed on free text
%improve performance considerably over an information retrieval baseline and a neural network language model trained on the same data.
%%
%%imposing discourse structure on free text allows high-quality alignment models to be inexpensively trained, and that these models can improve performance up to 49\% (relative) over strong information retrieval and neural network language model baselines.
