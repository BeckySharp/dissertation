%\title{Tell Me Why: Using Question Answering as Distant Supervision for Answer Justification}


%\begin{abstract}
%
%For many applications of question answering (QA), being able to explain why a given model chose an answer is critical.  However, the lack of labeled data for  answer justifications makes learning this difficult and expensive.  Here we propose an approach that uses answer ranking as distant supervision for learning how to select informative justifications. 
%We propose a neural network architecture for QA that reranks answer justifications as an intermediate (and human-interpretable) step in answer selection. Our approach is informed by a set of features designed to combine both learned representations and explicit features to capture the connection between questions, answers, and answer justifications.
% We show that with this end-to-end approach we are able to significantly improve upon a strong IR baseline in both justification ranking (+9\% rated highly relevant) and answer selection (+6\% P@1).  %We also provide an error analysis that demonstrates that we can use the justifications returned to better understand what our model has learned.
